## General impression

### Mechanical
2. Limits very close to mech stop. Need to adjust upper to get ome space.
5. Low Limit bent


### Electrical
Check electrical connections.

Test | Check| Verified| 
--- | --- | --- |
1  | Motor phase A resistance | OK
2  | Motor phase B resistance | OK
3  | Resolver stator sin resistance | OK
4  | Resolver stator cos resistance | OK
5  | Resolver rotor resistance | OK
6  | Low lim | OK
7  | High lim | OK
8  | Micro epsilon sensor adjusted | OK

## First test run
1.  squeqking/grinding noise (sounds like badly greased) at 0.75mm/s
2. Very close to run "over" upper limit switch. The cam is on top of the lever when switch is engaging.
2. Limits very close to mech stops. Readjusted lower limit to get some more margin
3. Use Velocity of 0.75mm/s for tests
4. Use same current as JJXRay
